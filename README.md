The website I built is a robust and user-friendly platform that offers a seamless online shopping experience. Here are some key highlights:

ðŸ”¹ Utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Node.js, and MongoDB, I developed a secure and responsive e-commerce website that caters to the needs of modern shoppers.

ðŸ”¹ With an emphasis on user authentication, I implemented a comprehensive system that allows customers to create accounts, log in securely, and log out with ease.

ðŸ”¹ A sophisticated cart system was built from scratch, enabling customers to effortlessly add or remove items and proceed to checkout seamlessly. Plus, to enhance convenience, I integrated a WhatsApp-based order placement feature.

ðŸ”¹ But that's not all! I also integrated advanced product filtering functionality, empowering users to easily search and find their desired products based on specific criteria like category, price range, and availability.

ðŸ”¹ Recognizing the importance of personalization, I designed and implemented a dynamic wishlist feature, allowing customers to save their favorite items for future reference.
